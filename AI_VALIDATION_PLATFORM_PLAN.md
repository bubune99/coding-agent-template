# AI Validation Platform (AVP) - Implementation Plan

**Project Vision:** An Electron-based coding platform combining v0's UI generation, automated Playwright validation, and intelligent orchestration for true end-to-end development from a single prompt with automatic error recovery and version rollback.

---

## 🚀 HIGH-LEVEL EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Fork** `vercel-labs/coding-agent-template` (don't clone - keep PR option open)
2. Add v0 Platform API integration
3. Implement basic Playwright validation
4. Build feedback loop MVP

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (Week 2)
1. Add master orchestration agent
2. Implement version control with smart rollback
3. Build project mapping system integration
4. Create prompt extraction engine

### Phase 3: Platform (Week 3)
1. Package as Electron app
2. Add Monaco editor integration
3. Build UI for monitoring/control
4. Polish and deploy

**Success Criteria:** Generate working app from 1-2 prompts → validate automatically → self-heal failures → rollback intelligently when stuck

## 📋 PART 1: ARCHITECTURE & COMPONENTS

### 1. Master Orchestration Agent

**Extract/Parse:**
- User's high-level intent (1-2 prompts)
- Project structure requirements
- Feature dependencies and order
- Success criteria for each component

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Break down this project: [user intent] into:
- Ordered list of features/components
- Dependencies between components
- Validation criteria for each
- Rollback conditions (when to abandon vs iterate)
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface MasterAgent {
  decomposeProject(userIntent: string): ProjectBlueprint;
  orchestrateExecution(blueprint: ProjectBlueprint): ExecutionPlan;
  monitorProgress(execution: ExecutionPlan): ExecutionStatus;
  decideNextAction(status: ExecutionStatus): Action;
}
```

### 2. Project Mapper Integration

**Extract:**
- Complete project blueprint
- Required files, folder structure, dependencies
- Step-by-step prompts for each component

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Given project: [blueprint], generate:
- File tree with all required files
- Sequence of generation prompts
- Validation tests for each component
- Integration checkpoints
```

**Data Flow:**
```
User Input → Project Mapper Platform → Blueprint
  ↓
Master Orchestration Agent → Execution Plan
  ↓
v0 Generation + Playwright Validation → Validated Code
```

### 3. Validation Engine

**Extract:**
- Generated code from v0
- Expected behaviors from prompts
- Test results from Playwright

**Parse Structure:**
```typescript
interface ValidationResult {
  component: string;
  expectedBehaviors: string[];
  testResults: {
    passed: TestCase[];
    failed: TestCase[];
  };
  attemptCount: number;
  rollbackThreshold: number;
}
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
class ValidationEngine {
  async validateComponent(code: string, tests: Test[]): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  parseTestResults(playwrightOutput: string): TestResult[];
  shouldRetry(result: ValidationResult): boolean;
  shouldRollback(result: ValidationResult): boolean;
}
```

### 4. Version Control & Rollback System

**Decision Tree:**
```
IF failures > rollbackThreshold:
  Calculate: similarity between current attempt and previous attempts

  IF stuck in loop (same errors repeating):
    → Rollback to last working version
    → Try alternative approach

  ELSE IF making progress (different/fewer errors):
    → Continue iterating

  ELSE:
    → Rollback and flag for human review
```

**Track These Metrics:**
- Git commits for each iteration
- Test results history
- Error patterns
- Success metrics per attempt

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface VersionControl {
  commitVersion(code: string, metadata: VersionMetadata): string;
  rollbackTo(commitHash: string): void;
  analyzeErrorPattern(history: Version[]): ErrorPattern;
  suggestAlternativeApproach(pattern: ErrorPattern): Approach;
}
```

## 🎯 PART 2: PROMPT ENGINEERING STRATEGY

### Master Agent System Prompt

```
You are a Master Orchestration Agent building: [PROJECT_NAME]

INPUT: [User's 1-2 sentence description]

YOUR TASKS:
1. DECOMPOSE into ordered features with dependencies
2. GENERATE prompts for each component (use v0 Platform API)
3. CREATE Playwright tests that validate each feature
4. MONITOR validation results
5. DECIDE: iterate, rollback, or proceed
6. ORCHESTRATE until complete or manual intervention needed

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
- Track attempt count per component
- After 3 failures: analyze error patterns
- If stuck in loop: rollback to last working state
- If making progress: continue with refined prompt
- If completely blocked: flag for human

OUTPUT: Working, validated, deployed application
```

### Component Generation Prompts

For each component, generate 3 artifacts:

**1. Generation Prompt (to v0)**
```
Create [COMPONENT] that:
- [Feature requirements]
- [Integration points]
- [Edge cases to handle]

Include Playwright tests that verify:
- [Specific behaviors to test]
```

**2. Validation Prompt (to Playwright)**
```
Test [COMPONENT] for:
✓ [Expected behavior 1]
✓ [Expected behavior 2]
✗ [Should not do X]

Return structured JSON with pass/fail per check
```

**3. Iteration Prompt (if tests fail)**
```
Previous attempt failed with:
[Structured error data]

Fix by:
- Analyzing root cause
- Proposing specific changes
- Avoiding previous failed approaches
- If 3rd attempt: consider alternative architecture
```

## 🔗 PART 5: INTEGRATION WITH PROJECT MAPPER

### Data Flow Diagram
```
User Input (1-2 prompts)
  ↓
Your Project Mapper Platform
  → Generates: Full blueprint
  → Outputs: Ordered prompts
  ↓
Master Orchestration Agent
  → Executes: Each prompt via v0
  → Validates: With Playwright
  → Decides: Iterate/Rollback/Proceed
  ↓
Self-Healing Loop
  → Monitors: Test results
  → Tracks: Version history
  → Rolls back: When stuck
  ↓
Deployed Application
```

### Integration Prompt Template
```
Connect project mapper output to orchestration:

INPUT from mapper:
{
  blueprint: [project structure],
  prompts: [ordered generation steps],
  validations: [test criteria]
}

Transform into orchestration plan:
1. For each prompt → v0 generation
2. For each validation → Playwright test
3. Track results → version control
4. Decide next action → iterate/rollback/proceed

Return execution graph with decision points
```

## 🧠 PART 6: ROLLBACK INTELLIGENCE

### Pattern Recognition Prompt
```
Analyze failure history:
[Array of past attempts with errors]

Determine:
1. Are we stuck in a loop? (same errors ≥2 times)
2. Are we making progress? (different errors, fewer failures)
3. Is there a pattern suggesting wrong approach?

DECISION:
- If loop → Rollback to version [X], try approach [Y]
- If progress → Continue with refinement [Z]
- If wrong approach → Rollback and pivot to [alternative]

Provide reasoning and confidence score
```

### Alternative Approach Generator Prompt
```
Current approach failed 3 times with pattern:
[Error pattern description]

Generate 2 alternative approaches:

APPROACH A (Conservative):
- Rollback to: [last stable version]
- Modify by: [minimal safe changes]
- Rationale: [why this might work]

APPROACH B (Innovative):
- Different architecture: [describe]
- New implementation: [outline]
- Rationale: [why this could succeed]

Recommend which to try based on: project constraints, time, complexity
```

## 🎨 KEY PROMPTS TO BUILD

1. **Project Decomposition**
   Break [user intent] into executable components with dependencies

2. **Component Generation**
   Create [component] with embedded validation tests

3. **Failure Analysis**
   Analyze [error history] and recommend: iterate, rollback, or pivot

4. **Rollback Decision**
   Should we rollback? Evidence: [attempts, patterns, progress]

5. **Alternative Generation**
   Given [failed approach], suggest different architecture

## 🎯 EXECUTION SUMMARY

### What You're Building
A platform that takes 1-2 prompts → generates complete project → validates automatically → self-heals intelligently → rolls back when stuck → deploys when complete

### How It Works
Master Agent orchestrates → Project Mapper provides blueprint → v0 generates code → Playwright validates → Smart rollback system prevents infinite loops → Human only intervenes when truly stuck

### Why It's Revolutionary
First platform that combines generation + validation + intelligent error recovery in one system. Knows when to give up and try something different instead of hallucinating forever.
